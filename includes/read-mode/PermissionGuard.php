/**
 * The permission callback of an Ability, wrapped so that read mode refuses it.
 *
 * WordPress 6.9's WP_Ability::execute() runs no filter that can veto an execution, and it does not check
 * that the Ability is still registered: an Ability object kept by other code before the read-mode sweep
 * (for example by another MCP adapter) can still be executed, and its permission callback is then the
 * only gate. (WordPress 7.1 adds wp_pre_execute_ability and wp_ability_permission_result, which read
 * mode also uses, see novamira_read_mode_pre_execute_ability().) The guard is bound to its Ability's name at registration and decides when it is called, so it
 * also holds when read mode is turned on after the object was kept.
 *
 * In read mode it refuses unless the name is on the allowlist, the administrator has not turned the Ability
 * off in the Abilities Hub, and the implementation is Novamira's own:
 * once the read-mode sweep has seen the object, the guard verifies that object; before that, it
 * verifies the registration arguments it was created from. It refuses with false, without calling the
 * wrapped callback. Not a WP_Error: WP_Ability::execute() reports a WP_Error from a permission callback
 * with _doing_it_wrong(), which would raise developer notices for other plugins' Abilities. The
 * read-mode wording reaches agents through Novamira's own gates instead. Outside read mode it returns
 * exactly what the wrapped callback returns.
